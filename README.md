# Introduction

Since Selenium has become the standard of testing for the web more and more tools now leverage it. Using these tools will enable you to be a more efficient tester. Even more than that you need to understand that you are a developer so in that case this book will be going into advanced coding topics as well and how they help you out in a practical sense.

I am the Lazy Coder and I will concede that sometimes it seems that I take the ongest road possible, however that occurs when I see more work down the road, so I will do everything in my power to prevent that work from showing up.

What do you want out of your career?

As the title implies this book will go into more than Selenium and go into other ttols that can help you in your career.

My goal for this book is to be starting point into being a Quality Engineer. To be precise, to know of the tools that can be used to automate as many of the quality related activities as possible. Yes you can have an entire career in just Automation Testing with Selenium but as I see the field in the near future it will be evolving and to enable you more you should learn the tools that will be the necessary soon.
